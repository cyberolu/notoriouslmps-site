      <h2>It starts with a bottle</h2>

      <p>
        NotoriousLMPs was born from a love of upcycling, colour, and objects
        that have lived a life before they became something new.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each lamp is handmade using carefully selected bottles, paired with
        bespoke shades to create bold, one of a kind statement pieces.
        No two are ever the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        Designed and handmade in Scotland, every piece is created slowly,
        thoughtfully, and with character. These are not mass produced lights.
        They are lamps with personality.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a piece is gone, it is gone. That is part of what makes each
        NotoriousLMPs lamp special.
